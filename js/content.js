While a large business may be able to hire outside consultants or engineers to create technology that helps them operate more efficiently, this may not be an option for a nonprofit despite the potential benefits.\nDigLit works with community-focused nonprofits to analyze their workflows, identify pain points, understand their capabilities, and then develops and implements solutions using existing or bespoke software and technology solutions.
